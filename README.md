# SQLmergeGuide

This repo houses a Merge / Join guide I wrote for the Center for Research Methods and Data Analysis (CRDMA) at the University of Kansas back when I was working there during my Ph.D. studies. 

Just download the HTML if you want to check out the guide, or clone the repo and Sweave the .Rnw file. I made this back when I was toying with the Sweave format and have since migrated to .Rmd for this kind of work.
