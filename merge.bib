	abstract = {This paper tests a variety of explanations for variation in distrust of local police in the US. As with other attitudes toward the police, there is a substantial race gap in distrust of the police. Our analysis is based upon citizen survey data from 33 cities and data on policing characteristics and the city context for those same cities. It reveals that individual‐level factors representative of a psychological model are of substantial importance in accounting for variation in distrust of the police. City‐level attributes tapping differences in police performance are also important predictors of citizen distrust of the police, even once individual‐level attributes are controlled; and there are important racial differences in the impact of these police performance variables as well, resulting in a largely full accounting of the initial race gap.},
